This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow
My name is Tylar Salter. I am a Sales Rep for a copier company at the moment, but I have big dreams and goals. I hope to one day help in the creation of video games both on the creative front and the technical. I look forward to learning more about GitHub as I advance in this endevor!
